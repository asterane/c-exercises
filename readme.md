# Overview

In this repository, I have collected my work done so far while
learning the C programming language. I am doing exercises from two
books at the moment: the eponymous work by Kerninghan and Ritchie, and
*C by Dissection* by Kelley and Pohl. I am still working through each
of these books, but I have several completed exercises here. I aim to
practice writing high quality, memory safe, and efficient code.

Much of my C work was done to complete problem sets for Harvard's
CS50x. I completed all of the C exercises for the class, which become
progressively more challenging. I worked with most of the basic
programming language concepts, and implemented several algorithms and
data structures from scratch, including sorts, lists, tables, and
custom analysis tools.

# *The C Programming Language*

These exercises are in `kr-c`. Included are some example programs from
the text, as well as the programs I wrote to complete the exercises at
the end of sections. I am continuing to read and work through this
book.

# *C by Dissection*

These exercises are in `c-dissection`. I recently started this book,
and have included example programs and problem solutions, similar to
my work for K&R.

# CS50x

Much of my work in C has been undertaken to complete the requirements
for this truly excellent class. The problem sets are in `cs50`. Some
of these include code or resources provided by the class. Everything
in `cs50/pset1` and `cs50/pset2` is my own work. In `cs50/pset3`, all
of the functions outside of the `main` functions are my own work. In
`cs50/pset4`, `recover.c` and `helpers.c` are all my own work. In
`cs50/pset5`, `dictionary.c` and `hashchk.c` are all my own work. All
code and resources not mentioned here were provided as part of the
problem sets.

# Other

The `other` directory contains any basic C work I have done outside of
working through a book or a class.
